# International Organized Violence
Exploring the dynamics and trends of international organized violence between 1946-2017


## I. Investigation Overview

In this investigation I want to examine the trends in the **1,221 conflicts** & **1,550 dyads** worldwide from 1946 to 2017 in the dataset. <br>
The primary features of analysis is the variation over time and across categories of conflicts of:
1. the frequency and characteristics of conflicts from 1946 to 2017, 
2. the identity and type of support warring parties receive from foreign entities parties,
3. number of new conflicts versus the persistence of existing conflicts over time and
4. the effect of rebel ideology, goal, religious affiliation and external support on conflict outcomes as well as variations in the frequency of outcome types
<br>
<br>

## II. Dataset Overview

The dataset is an integration of

1. [The Uppsala Conflict Data Program Data Files](https://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/): the world’s main provider of data on organized violence and armed conflicts. The files used are:
- UCDP Georeferenced Event Dataset Global version 18.1
- UCDP One-sided Violence Dataset
- UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset version 18.1
- UCDP Dyadic Dataset version 18.1
- UCDP Conflict Termination Dataset version 2-2015
<br>

2. [Non-State Actor Dataset](http://ksgleditsch.com/eacd.html): provides information on the military capabilities and politicalopportunities available to non-state actors in on-going civil wars. It is a direct expansion of the Uppsala Armed Conflict Data.
<br>

3. [The Foundations of Rebel Group Emergence Dataset](https://www.jessicamaves.com/forge.html): provides information onthe origins of violent non-state actors engaged in armed conflict against their government. It draws upon the population of groups included in the Non-State Actor Dataset.
<br>
<br>
The features of the dataset are characteristics of the dyad in each year the dyad is active (i.e. results in 25 or more battle related deaths). These characteristics include the type of conflict, the parties involved, the location of the conflict, the ideology, religious affiliation and goal of the rebel group involved.

## III. Terminology

**Conflicts vs Dyads**:
 Conflicts are defined in terms of a single actor being targeted while dyads involve two armed and opposing actors. For example, the Government of Bolivia has been involved in three dyads:
1. Government of Bolivia vs Popular Revolutionary Movement
2. Government of Bolivia vs MNR
3. Government of Bolivia vs ELN

However, these *three dyads* are recorded as a *single conflict*. Conflicts are viewed through the lens of the targeted actor - in this case the Government of Bolivia.

The number of dyads will therefore exceed the number of conflicts.
<br>
<br>

**Conflicts Types**:
The Uppsala Conflict Data Program conducted by the Uppsala University defines and provides data on three types of conflicts worldwide:
There are three types of conflicts:
1. State-based conflict: dyad involves two actors (with one or more being the government) that have a stated incompatibility
2. Non-state conflict: dyad is constructed by at least two organized actors (of which none is the government of a state) that oppose each other with arms. 
3. One-sided Events: involves not dyads but armed actors (a government or a formally organized non-state group) attacking the civilian population
   
**Note**:
While the dataset ranges from 1946-2017 only data for state based conflicts dates back to 1946. The recording of non-state and one-sided conflicts begins as of 1989. Comparisons across conflict types will therefore be restricted between 1989 to 2017.



## IV. Goal of Analysis

The goal of this exploratory analysis is to understand trends in each of these three types of conflicts as well as worldwide conflicts in general. 
This includes:
1. Understanding the how number of conflicts and fatalities have changed over time,
2. The ratio of new conflicts versus existing conflicts,
3. The actors directly and indirectly involved in conflicts and 
4. The effect of rebel ideology, goal, religious affiliation and external support on conflict outcomes as well as how changes in the explicit outcome itself contribute to the understanding the ontological and temporal characteristics of conflicts.


## V. Key Findings
1. Between 1989 and 2017 there have been 1307 dyads that roll up into 1112 conflicts. The highest number of dyads are non-state at 670 followed by state-based dyads at 371 (which roll up into 176 conflicts) and one-sided conflicts at 266. Following the end of the Cold War, the number of conflicts worldwide had decreased substantially however in the last decade there has been a volatile, but salient increaes in the number of conflicts (and dyads). This upward trend is evident spans across all three categories of conflicts: state-based, non-state and one-sided. 
2. Non-state violence has contributed the highest increase in conflict frequecy follow by state violence and then one-side violence (which have mostly been perpetuated by governments and shown only a marginal increase over the last decade). 
3. At an aggregate level, most state-based conflicts appear to be internal i.e. between a government and an organized rebel group. 
4. Russia, Libya, US and China are among the top governments extending foreign support to both Rebel Groups and Governments in dyads. 
5. While the number of conflicts has increased signficantly over time (105% between 2010 and 2017) it appears these conflicts are smaller scale as the number of battle related deaths per year has been in decline since 2014. Therefore conflicts appear to have increase in numbers but declined in intensity.
6.	Internal followed by internationalized internal conflicts have been the dominant contributers to the increase in conflicts in the last decade.The explosion in the internal and internationalized internal conflicts is due in large part to two drivers. First were the struggles over control in newly formed states soon after they achieved independence from colonial powers; second was the Cold War that fuelled many “proxy wars” in the developing world.
7.	While there has been an increase in the number of dyads it is interesting to distinguish between the onset (start) of new dyads, the incidence (or continuation) of existence dyads and the termination of dyads.	At an aggregate level the number of ongoing dyads is higher than the number of new dyads.	The rate of termination of conflicts is marginal compared to the rates of conflict onset and incidence.	With the exception of nonstate dyads the rise in the number of conflicts is therefore largely due to a low rate of conflict termination rather than a high rate of conflict onset.
