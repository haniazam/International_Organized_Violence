# International Organized Violence
Exploring the dynamics and trends of international organized violence between 1946-2017


## Investigation Overview

In this investigation I want to examine the trends in the **1,221 conflicts** & **1,550 dyads** worldwide from 1946 to 2017 in the dataset. <br>
The primary features of analysis is the variation over time and across categories of conflicts of:
1. the frequency and characteristics of conflicts from 1946 to 2017, 
2. the identity and type of support warring parties receive from foreign entities parties,
3. number of new conflicts versus the persistence of existing conflicts over time and
4. the effect of rebel ideology, goal, religious affiliation and external support on conflict outcomes as well as variations in the frequency of outcome types
<br>
<br>

## Dataset Overview

The dataset is an integration of:
1. **The Uppsala Conflict Data Program Data Files**: the worldâ€™s main provider of data on organized violence and armed conflicts. The files used are:
- UCDP Georeferenced Event Dataset Global version 18.1
- UCDP One-sided Violence Dataset
- UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset version 18.1
- UCDP Dyadic Dataset version 18.1
- UCDP Conflict Termination Dataset version 2-2015
<br>
2. **Non-State Actor Dataset**: provides information on the military capabilities and politicalopportunities available to non-state actors in on-going civil wars. It is a direct expansion of the Uppsala Armed Conflict Data.
<br>
3. **The Foundations of Rebel Group Emergence Dataset**: provides information onthe origins of violent non-state actors engaged in armed conflict against their government. It draws upon the population of groups included in the Non-State Actor Dataset.<
<br>
<br>
The features of the dataset are characteristics of the dyad in each year the dyad is active (i.e. results in 25 or more battle related deaths). These characteristics include the type of conflict, the parties involved, the location of the conflict, the ideology, religious affiliation and goal of the rebel group involved.

## Terminology

**Conflicts vs Dyads:**
> Conflicts are defined in terms of a single actor being targeted while dyads involve two armed and opposing actors. For example, the Government of Bolivia has been involved in three dyads:
1. Government of Bolivia vs Popular Revolutionary Movement
2. Government of Bolivia vs MNR
3. Government of Bolivia vs ELN

However, these *three dyads* are recorded as a *single conflict*. Conflicts are viewed through the lens of the targeted actor - in this case the Government of Bolivia.

The number of dyads will therefore exceed the number of conflicts.

<br>
<br>

**Conflicts Types:**
> There are three types of conflicts:
1. State-based conflict: dyad involves two actors (with one or more being the government) that have a stated incompatibility
2. Non-state conflict: dyad is constructed by at least two organized actors (of which none is the government of a state) that oppose each other with arms. 
3. One-sided Events: involves not dyads but armed actors (a government or a formally organized non-state group) attacking the civilian population
    

**Note:**
While the dataset ranges from 1946-2017 only data for state based conflicts dates back to 1946. The recording of non-state and one-sided conflicts begins as of 1989. Comparisons across conflict types will therefore be restricted between 1989 to 2017.
